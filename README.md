Tic-Tac-Toe (or Noughts and crosses, Xs and Os) is a pencil-and-paper game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three respective marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

Player Wins

If a player gets three of their pieces in a row they win. This means if they get three pieces diagonally, vertically, or horizontally.

Players Draw

When a square is played its number is replaced with a mark, which is a string (i.e. “x” or “o”). Therefore we know the game has been tied when the board has no more numbers because all of the squares will have been played.
